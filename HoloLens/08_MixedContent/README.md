The main code lives in `Program.cs`

This sample is based on the Mutant sample. It shows how to create a mixed scene in the Hololens world with Urho and XAML. It creates a XAML window with a button on it.
Clicking on the button will switch to a holographic space where you can control a Mutant via a series of Cortana voice commands.   

WWith the voice command 'back' you can switch back to the XAML view.

The important parts of the sample are in Program.cs, in App.xaml.cs and in MainPage.xaml.cs
